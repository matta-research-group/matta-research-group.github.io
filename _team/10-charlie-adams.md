Charlie Adams is a research software engineer in the Matta group, working on building a high-throughput screening database for mixed organic conduction materials. In particular, he is focusing on how to leverage Quantum Chemistry (QC) and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations to build structure-activity relationships with experimental results. 

He obtained his PhD in Computational Chemistry from The University of Sheffield in 2023, calculating novel jet fuel autoxidation pathways for new sustainable fuels. Afterwards he worked in industry for a year as a process modeler for DBD International. Then he perused a knowledge transfer partnership (KTP) with Newcastle University and Kuano, designing a  machine learning partial charge model built on the back of high-throughput QM calculations.
